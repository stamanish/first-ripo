Finally I got was able to understand the git concept . But I am still learning.
One this i found out while studing git , programmin and other compueter science topics is:
If you dont understand something , something new that your are learing dont get stuck . Make a note at that point in time (write it down or make a not on your pc)
and continue through the learning(course) and there will be a point in the future youll automatically feel like you are understaing the topic that you were confuseing before . Go back to the lesson for that topic and revise .
This techinque has personally help me in many topics .
